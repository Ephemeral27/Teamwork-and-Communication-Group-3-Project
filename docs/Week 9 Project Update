What we shipped/completed this week:
• Finished coding part 3 (Splits up tasks evenly across days based on start date, due date and subtasks)
• Finish coding part 4 (Prints out task to do each day in clear and easy to read format)
• Finished debugging part 3 and 4, so it runs with parts 1 and 2

• https://github.com/Ephemeral27/Teamwork-and-Communication-Group-3-Project/blob/main/combined_project.py

Decisions made (owner, date):
• Work on presentation (Everyone, Week 10)
• Practise presentation (Everyone, Week 10)

Challenges & risks (severity, mitigation):
• Time management: Managing this project along with other classes as finals are nearing 
• Miscommunication: as multiple people will be making a presentation together and practising together

Plan for next week (task → owner → due date):
• Review final code to ensure everything is correct (debugging if necessary) → Everyone → Week 10
• Create slideshow for presentation → Everyone → Week 10 
• Rehearsing scripts for presentation  → Everyone → Week 10 
Optional Self‑Evaluation (per week)
