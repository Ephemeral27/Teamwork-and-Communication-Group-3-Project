\## User stories and Acceptance Criteria

<Short paragraph: This section covers the user stories we collected, and the acceptance criteria for the project> 



\## EPIC: Our goal is to help students break down and organize their work to create an efficient schedule to allow them to complete their work without stress or missing important deadlines, while maintaining a work-life balance. 

\- <As a student with extracurriculars, I want to be able to plan my school work schedule around my extracurriculars so that I can stay on top of my work and still be able to do my extracurriculars.> 

\- <As a student with fewer but more labour-intensive assignments, I want to be able to divide an assignment into multiple parts and do it over a few days, so that I don’t cram the assignment in last minute> 





\## Acceptance Criteria (Given/When/Then)

\- <Given the program prompt, when the users enter tasks into the database, then organize tasks by availability.>

\- <Given the program prompt, when the user requests to view the schedule, then print the schedule.

“Example: Given I open the timer, When I press Start, Then a 25-minute countdown begins.”>
